# Query Params Store

## ⚠️ Currently under development ️️️️️️️⚠️

Developing applications often requires persisting state and what better way than using the query params for that. With this npm module (`yarn add query-params-store` || `npm install query-params-store`) you can easily configure what query params your application route will have, what are the default values (values used when the query param doesn't exist in the URL),
restrict what query params can be used on the current route and more. For more info [check out the demo](https://stackblitz.com/github/IliaIdakiev/query-param-store)!
